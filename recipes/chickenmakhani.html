    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong><em>Chicken Makhani, widely known as Butter Chicken, is one of the most beloved and iconic dishes of Indian cuisine, originating in Delhi in the 1950s. This dish features tender pieces of chicken that have been marinated, usually in yogurt and spices, and then cooked in a rich, creamy, and mildly spiced tomato sauce.</p>
    <p>The hallmark of Chicken Makhani is its luxurious gravy. It achieves its characteristic velvety texture and slightly sweet, tangy flavor through the use of pureed tomatoes, a generous amount of butter (hence the name), and cream. A balanced blend of spices, including garam masala, fenugreek leaves (kasoori methi), and sometimes a touch of sugar, ensures a complex but non-spicy profile. It is the quintessential comfort food, typically served with naan bread or basmati rice to soak up the decadent sauce.</em></strong></p>
