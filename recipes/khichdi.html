    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <strong><li>1/2 cup Basmati Rice or Short-grain Rice</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Yellow Split Moong Dal </li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon Turmeric Powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon Salt </li>
        <li>4 cups Water </li>
        
        <li>2 tablespoons Ghee or oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Cumin Seeds</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon Asafoetida </li>
        <li>2-3 Green Chilies, slit</li>
        <li>1 inch piece Ginger, grated</li>
        <li>A few Curry Leaves </li>
        
        <li>Extra Ghee, for topping</li>
        <li>Plain Yogurt or Pickle </li></strong>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <strong><li>Prepare Rice and Dal: Rinse the rice and moong dal together 2-3 times until the water runs clear. Soak them together in fresh water for about 30 minutes (optional, but helps speed up cooking).</li>
        <li>Pressure Cook: Drain the rice and dal and transfer them to a pressure cooker. Add the turmeric powder, salt, and 4 cups of water. Close the lid and cook for 3-4 whistles (or until very soft and mushy).</li>
        <li>Prepare Tempering (Tadka): In a small pan, heat the ghee (or oil) over medium heat. Add the cumin seeds and allow them to splutter.</li>
        <li>Add Aromatics: Add the asafoetida (Hing), green chilies, and grated ginger. Sauté for about 30 seconds until the ginger is fragrant. Add the curry leaves (if using).</li>
        <li>Combine: Pour the hot tempering mixture directly into the cooked khichdi in the pressure cooker. Mix well. If the khichdi is too thick, add a little hot water to reach your desired consistency and simmer for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve: Serve the Khichdi immediately in a bowl, topped with a generous spoonful of hot ghee and accompanied by yogurt or pickle.</li></strong>
    </ol>
