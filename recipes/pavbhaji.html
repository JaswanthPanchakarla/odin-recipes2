    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
       <strong><li>3 medium Potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>1 cup Cauliflower florets, chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup Green Peas </li>
        <li>1 large Carrot, chopped</li>
        
        <li>4 tablespoons Butter (plus extra for toasting pav)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Cumin Seeds</li>
        <li>1 medium Onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 Green Bell Pepper (Capsicum), finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Ginger-Garlic Paste</li>
        <li>2 cups Tomatoes, finely chopped</li>
        
        <li>2 tablespoons Pav Bhaji Masala</li>
        <li>1-2 teaspoons Kashmiri Red Chili Powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon Turmeric Powder</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Water </li>
        
        <li>8 Pav </li>
        <li>Lemon wedges, chopped onion, and fresh cilantro (for garnish)</li></strong>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <strong><li>Cook the Vegetables: In a pressure cooker or large pot, combine the potatoes, cauliflower, peas, and carrot with water. Cook until the vegetables are very soft. Mash them coarsely with a potato masher and set aside.</li>
        <li>Sauté Aromatics: In a large pan or tawa, heat 2 tablespoons of butter and 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the cumin seeds. Add the chopped onion and sauté until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Build the Masala: Add the ginger-garlic paste and sauté for 30 seconds. Next, add the bell pepper and cook until soft, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add Tomatoes and Spices: Add the chopped tomatoes and salt. Cook until the tomatoes are completely mushy. Add the Pav Bhaji Masala, chili powder, and turmeric. Mix well and cook for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Combine and Mash: Add the mashed vegetables to the pan. Use the potato masher again to mix everything together and mash until the bhaji reaches a semi-smooth consistency. Add water to adjust the thickness.</li>
        <li>Simmer and Finish: Simmer the bhaji for 5-10 minutes, allowing the flavors to blend. Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter. Taste and adjust salt or masala.</li>
        <li>Toast the Pav: Slit the pav horizontally. Heat a small amount of butter on a flat pan. Toast the pav on both sides until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Serve: Serve the hot bhaji topped with a dollop of butter, chopped cilantro, and raw onions, accompanied by the toasted pav and a lemon wedge.</li></strong>
    </ol>
